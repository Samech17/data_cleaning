Data Cleaning and Analysis Report,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Objective:,,,,,,,,
"The goal of this project was to clean and analyze the dataset by removing duplicate IDs, handling infinite values in the Price Per Unit column, and performing a regional analysis to determine the total quantity sold and total value per region.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Step Taken:,,,,,,,,
1. The dataset was checked for duplicate entries based on the ID column,,,,,,,,
"2. Using the ""Remove Duplicates"" feature, duplicate records were eliminated to ensure data integrity.",,,,,,,,
"3. The ""Price Per Unit"" column was examined for any occurrences of the value ""inf"".",,,,,,,,
"4. Rows containing ""inf"" were removed by applying filter to the price column and delete the row that contains ""inf""",,,,,,,,
"5. A new column, ""Total Value"", was created using the formula: =Quantity * Price Per Unit.",,,,,,,,
6. The data was converted into a table and renamed,,,,,,,,
6. A Pivot Table was generated to summarize total quantity sold and total value for each region.,,,,,,,,
7. A short report explaining your steps and insights from the cleaned data.,,,,,,,,
